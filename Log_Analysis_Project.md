## Testing Softwares Installation Procedure:

1. **Graylog Installation**

- Followed According to it's documentation Instruction;
    ðŸ‘‰[**Instructions for Installation**](https://go2docs.graylog.org/5-1/downloading_and_installing_graylog/ubuntu_installation.html)ðŸ‘ˆ
    1. Installing Mongodb and Opensearch for Dependency,
    2. Then Config the Opensearch YAML file.


#### Graylog Functionality:

![img01](imgs/graylog_img01.png)

- Defining Ports and Inputs, to get the particular data from running service on the machine.

- Data is then **Stored** in **two forms** : **unstructured** and **structured**.

- The **Structured Data** is much convenient cause it helps to categorize and analyze the data, but we've also an option to **search through unstructured data** just in needed case.

- Then It'll prepare the Index according to the Final Log Data we get.

#### Inspiration from Graylog:

- The ecosystem is clean and simple.

- ID Reference to the logs, especially better for creating a custom category to view some specific data.

- Support Custom configuration and settings to manage data with prepared queries.

- Notifications facility (able to inform to clients and owners by sending a copy of report)

- Pulling Up data from multiple sources (services) and able to create custom data extractor for specific need.

2. **Nagios Core 

## Project Discussion:

### Project Design:

#### Logs Fetching Manner:

- All important logs will be fetched in a raw manner first (unstructured data) and their is also a option in the UI Logs Viewer Panel to checkout the **raw logs**
