## IP Address Practical
- We can't set the IP by setting the first octet bit on
- And can't leave the host bit with the 0
- also neither all of the host bit in the network can be 1 (reserved for broadcast address)
- while configuring IP you'll get the subnet mask auto for that IPv4 class.
- Jio gateway: 192.168.29.1
- Airtel gateway: 192.168.0.1

## Errors:

- Host unreachable in the case same nework IP but not present in the network.
- Trasmit failed, in the case of the different network IP.
- 

## Example for allotting the Class C IP:

- from 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.254

## Practicals to do:

- provide the simple IPv4 with the same network and try to communicate with the same network IP devices.
- provide the IPv4 with a subnet mask, in both manner classless and classful
