### Working in a Repository with a separate branch

- Checking Branches

```
git branch
```

- Creating a Branch

```
git branch nameofthebranch
```

- Changing the branch

```
git checkout nameofthebranch
```

- Creating a Branch and shifting to it at the same time:

```
git checkout -b newbranchname
```

### Best Practice to work in a local repo: 

- Change the working branch to `main`

```
git checkout main
```

- Pulling the latest changes:

```
git pull
```

### Contributing in the Professional Manner:

- Mainly Two things could happen:

    1. Fixing a Bug
    2. Working on a Feature

- You'll create branch name according to these two factors:

    **example**:

    - Bug: There is no flowchart of file, adding a Flowchart!
        - branch name will be like: `fix/flowchart`
    - Feature: There is a feature suggestion on File Types!
        - branch will be like: `feat/file_types`
